Hi there,

I decided to start TIL (Today I Learned) series ! 

Rodrigo, author of [Mathspp](https://mathspp.com/) blog, give me envy to do so with his TIL series, as I told him, I will do that to help me to remind me some stuff and share what I discovered to everyone who can be interested on. I'm dedicating my first TIL of a great series to him I hope.

I started to create a dark mode for Django project and I face to an interesting issue : accessibility.

This is something Iâ€™m aware of, but I discovered I have so many things to learn ! 
Even my website is really bad for accessibility.. but I learned some ressources very useful which deserve to be written somewhere.

Accessibility concern many cases : *Tritanopia*, *Deuteranomaly* and so on. 

[Whocanuse](https://whocanuse.com/), is based on the same purpose of [Caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) but for accessibility and contrast. 

Itâ€™s really useful to see the simulation of color for each type of vision and contrast with another color. It really helps me to better adjust color contrast.

Note: you can also see color contrast and ratio in devtools of Chrome :

You also have [Kontrasto](https://kontrasto.netlify.app/), created by Thibaud Colas, which have a deep interest in accessibility ðŸ™‚

Really nice to see a way to improve accessibility with images.

I also discovered [Link Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/linkcontrastchecker/) which is a website to see the contrast for links to be sure there are no violation for accessibility.

I find [accessibility checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) which can be a good start to make you website more inclusive and see some point you missed.

As I am a big fan of pipelines, there are also tools to check accessibility with desktop extension or in continuous integration: 

- [aXe](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
- [pa11y](https://pa11y.org/)
- ...

That's it for now! I hope it will be useful for someone.
